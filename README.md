# OGC_WCS_use-cases
This repo contains a practical use case how an OGC Web Coverage Service (WCS) request can be integrated into a geospatial data analysis workflow.

### NOTE: <br>
The example service was switched off. The use case shows anyway the principle how OGC requests can be part of the geospatial data analysis workflow.
